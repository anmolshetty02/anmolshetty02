## 👨‍💻 About Me

**I find business problems and build AI solutions to fix them.**

That's it. I don't just analyze data or write code—I do the whole loop: spot the problem, architect the solution, deploy it, measure the impact.

Currently pursuing MS in Information Systems at Northeastern University. Seeking Data Engineering, AI/ML, or BI co-op roles starting January 2026.

**Recent wins:**
- Built AI-powered BI platform that cut executive reporting time from 4 hours to 30 minutes
- Developed deep learning system for driver safety (82% accuracy on EEG signals)
- Automated healthcare analytics pipeline (30% efficiency gain, 27% accuracy improvement)

📍 **Location:** Boston, MA
